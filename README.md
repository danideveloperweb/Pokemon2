# Pokemon

## Description 

In this project, a SPA is being built in which only one page with Pokemon cards will be displayed. The cards are responsive, and a navbar and footer component have also been created. A fake database has been created in the module to assist the service that will inject the information.

## Main features

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that guarantees that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. In this project, this design pattern has been used because we load the services from the providers with a single instance.

Mixin is being used in SCSS, which is a technique that allows for code reuse where a class incorporates methods and properties from another class without inheriting from it. Instead of inheriting from a single base class, a class can incorporate functionalities from one or several mixins, allowing the creation of classes with specific combinations of behaviors.
Bootstrap has been used to make the application responsive and aesthetically appealing.
